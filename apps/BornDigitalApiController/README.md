# Born Digital API Controller

NodeJS application exposing all API endpoints needed by the Born Digital API.

This section is _not_ required for the Education Platform.

This is a purely back-end application and primarily accepts and returns JSON. HTML is not returned from any API endpoints.

## Hacking

This is a KoaJS application that uses Typescript.

You should make sure the Docker instances are running before attempting to modify any files here. See the top-level README for instructions on how to do this.

Once the Docker instances are running, this Application will listen for requests on port 13300.
