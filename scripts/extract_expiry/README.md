# Extract expiry

NodeJS-based command line tool to expire extracts after the copy limit is reduced globally from 20% (or any other percentage) down to 5%.

This was used in March 2021 when the global class copy limit was reduced back down to the normal 5% after it was temporarily increased to 20% during the covid lockdown.
